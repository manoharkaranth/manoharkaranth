#### Hello ðŸ‘‹,

Distributed computing and cloud platforms enable faster and scalable data science and engineering solutions. This technical portfolio showcases implementation solutions across various facets of data science and engineering, with a deliberate emphasis on big data and cloud computing. Key technologies integrated here include AI/ML, MLOps, AWS, GCP, Spark, Python, and Hadoop.

Since data are the fuel for any data-driven solution, relevant datasets are provided with brief descriptions in the respective Assets sub-sections. Suggestions and criticisms are equally welcome.

Happy learning!
