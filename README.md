### Greetings ðŸ‘‹, This portfolio is an undertake to traverse various facets of data science in a problem-solution manner. Python, AWS, Spark and Tableau are the key technologies incorporated over here. Most of the notebooks are molded to be reproducible. In the wake of this, separate badges are provisioned for interactive and non-interactive previews. However, it should not be construed as reproducibility implies correctness and vice versa. Also, since data are fuel to any data-driven solution, they are attached along with brief description in the respective _Assets_ sub-sections. Both suggestions and criticisms are equally acceptable. Happy learning!
